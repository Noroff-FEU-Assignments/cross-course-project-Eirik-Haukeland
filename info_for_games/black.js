  "desc": "The creature was half as tall as a man and moved crouched and close to the ground. Its nightmarish frame was gaunt and emaciated. Its body appeared to be covered in teeth growing out of its skin. It had 2 arms that were long and stick like. Two grotesque arms sprouted from its back like wings. Its face was skull like. Its mouth was filled with glowing teeth. It had a single bulging pastel green stock for an eye.",
