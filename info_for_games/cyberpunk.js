  "desc": "Ilaektra “Starchaser” Zal is the youngest Sergeant in the history of the Planetary Guard, and daughter of Titaen Zal, Commander of the airspace above Ki, and of all the Planetary Guard. She normally works routine shifts at the transfer center, supervising security of all transportation operations between Ki and it’s satellite, Ma. But her father recruits her for a mysterious mission that takes the two of them deep underground into the Guard headquarters and into a largely abandoned section he calls “The Arc Section.” When she realizes the mission is unsanctioned, she is hesitant, but her father explains to her that he has received information about “prepping” “control planet 13” and that he “isn’t going to let that happen.” When Ilaektra, who believes in the control planet experiments, asks him why, he informs her that in order to begin a new control planet, all previous life will be wiped, to which Ilaektra answers, “So?”",
